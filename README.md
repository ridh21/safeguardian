```

### 1. Continuous Monitoring Layer

The AI Agent runs as a background service, continuously collecting data from multiple sensors:

- **GPS/Location Services**: Tracks your position every 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Accelerometer**: Monitors movement patterns 50 times per second
- **Gyroscope**: Detects orientation changes and sudden movements
- **Microphone** (when permitted): Periodically samples ambient audio for threat detection

### 2. Pattern Learning & Recognition

```
Daily Pattern Learning:
├── Home Location Detection
├── Work/School Location
├── Regular Commute Routes
├── Typical Travel Times
├── Frequently Visited Places
└── Normal Activity Patterns
```

The AI learns your routine over 7-14 days and establishes a behavioral baseline:

- **Time-Based Patterns**: When you typically leave home, arrive at work, etc.
- **Location Patterns**: Places you regularly visit
- **Movement Patterns**: How you typically walk, your average speed
- **Route Patterns**: Your usual paths for commuting

### 3. Anomaly Detection Engine

The AI continuously compares real-time data against your learned patterns:

| Anomaly Type | Detection Method | Risk Level |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Route Deviation | GPS path analysis | Medium |
| Unusual Stop | Location + time analysis | High |
| Sudden Speed Change | Accelerometer data | High |
| Late Night Travel | Time + location | Medium |
| Unfamiliar Area | Location history | Low-Medium |
| Erratic Movement | Motion patterns | High |
| Fall Detection | Accelerometer spike | Critical |

### 4. Risk Assessment Algorithm

```python
# Simplified Risk Calculation
risk_score = (
    location_risk × 0.25 +
    time_risk × 0.20 +
    motion_anomaly × 0.25 +
    route_deviation × 0.15 +
    environmental_factors × 0.15
)

# Risk Levels
LOW:      0.0 - 0.3  → Silent monitoring
MEDIUM:   0.3 - 0.6  → Increased monitoring frequency
HIGH:     0.6 - 0.8  → Alert user, prepare emergency
CRITICAL: 0.8 - 1.0  → Auto-trigger emergency protocol
```

### 5. Intelligent Response System

Based on the risk assessment, the AI Agent takes appropriate actions:

#### Low Risk (Green Zone)
- Standard monitoring every 30 seconds
- Battery-optimized operation
- Background data collection

#### Medium Risk (Yellow Zone)
- Increased monitoring frequency (every 10 seconds)
- Pre-loads emergency contacts
- Subtle notification to user
- Prepares location sharing

#### High Risk (Orange Zone)
- Real-time continuous monitoring
- Displays safety prompt to user
- Auto-enables audio recording
- Notifies primary emergency contact of concern
- Ready to escalate within seconds

#### Critical Risk (Red Zone)
- Immediate SOS activation
- Auto-calls emergency contacts
- Sends location to all trusted contacts
- Begins audio/video recording
- Contacts emergency services if configured
- Activates loud alarm (if enabled)

### 6. Machine Learning Models

SafeGuardian employs several ML models:

| Model | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Location Classifier | Safe/Unsafe area prediction | Weekly |
| Activity Recognition | Movement type detection | Real-time |
| Anomaly Detector | Unusual behavior identification | Daily |
| Time Series Predictor | Route and ETA prediction | Per journey |
| Audio Classifier | Threat sound detection | Real-time |

### 7. Privacy-First AI Processing

All AI processing happens **on-device** to protect your privacy:

- ✅ Sensor data processed locally
- ✅ Patterns stored only on your device
- ✅ No personal data sent to servers
- ✅ Emergency data shared only with your contacts
- ✅ You control all data sharing settings
